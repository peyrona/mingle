Stick : Mingle Execution Environment

Syntax:
    stick [[options] <fileName[.model]>]

FileName: One (and only one) model to execute. i.e. {*home*}examples/01.clock (no wildcards allowed).
          Extension (.model) is not mandatory, but if absent, ".model" is added to the file name.

Options:
    -config=<URI>  URI to the configuration file to use (local file or remote file). By default: {*home*}config.json.
    -help | -h     Shows this help.

Transpiled (*.model) as well as config file can be in the following forms:
    * File name (in absolute or relative path and with or without file extension)
    * URI:
        file://<file>
        http://<URI>
        https://<URI>

If no model is passed, one or more will be searched at configuration file, if none, Stick will run without a model (DEVICEs and RULEs can be added on the fly), but only if at least one communication channel is defined.

By default, file '{*home*}config.json' is used as configuration file. If it does not exists, default values are used.
Nevertheless configuration values stored in files can be overridden using the options above and/or passing values to the JVM and/or OS Environment variables.

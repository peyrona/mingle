/**
 * Base interface for: Device, Driver, Rule and Script commands.
 * <p>
 * Implementation notes:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>For classes that are accessed only by Java code (e.g. those used by the 'Tape'),
 *        Collections are preferred over arrays ([]) because they are easier to manage</li>
 *    <li>For classes that can be accessed from Java code as well as other languages (e.g. JS
 *        or Python) arrays are preferred over Collections for their public interfaces, because
 *        they are easier to manage by these languages.</li>
 *    <li>Internally when writting Java code, Collections are preferred over arrays.</li>
 *    <li>Then, all classes used by ExEn will internally use Collections but they will expose
 *        arrays in their public interfaces as well as the methods tro manipulate (add & remove)
 *        array's items.</li>
 * </ul>

# This Une code is part of the Grid example, which is composed by three source (.une) files.
# The goal of this example is to show how MSP Grids work.
# To know more about MSP Grids, please refer to the The_Mingle_Standard_Platform.pdf handbook.
#
# To compile you need to check the "Grid" checkbox in the Glue Sources Editor or to a add -grid=true when using the Tape tool.

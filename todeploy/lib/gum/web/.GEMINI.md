This project aims to make a dashboard designer and its executor (viewer).
To do this, it connects to a Java server via AJAX and collects all the necessary information.

The files of this project are distributed in this directory and all the subdirectories from this one.
This project uses only HTML5, CSS3 and JS 6 libraries and the only accepted libraries are the ones in this file-tree. Use the JQuery library whenever possible.

When you write code you have to use the same coding style as the pre-existing files and you have to document all classes and methods and functions that you are going to create; and all in English.
You have to prioritize code clarity over execution speed and the code has to be compatible with the most used modern web browsers. 
This project will run only on tablets and PCs, so it does not have to be compatible with cell phone screen dimensions.

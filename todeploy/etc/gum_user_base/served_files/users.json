# This is a very simplistic file and the use of it made by the HTTP server is even simpler.
#
# While user-name is case insensitive, user-password is case sensitive.
#
# Following macros can be used (only in user-password, not in user-name):
#   + {*d*} -> Will be replaced by current day of the month
#   + {*h*} -> Will be replaced by current hour of the day
#
# Example: "pwd": "{*d*}admin{*h*}"
#
# Before saving, be sure the contents of this file are JSON compliant.
#
# // TODO: improve how users are used by the HHTP Server
#          Much more work has to be done in this area.

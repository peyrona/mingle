# This file contains DRIVERs for several devices manufactured by the LedNet (http://www.ledenet.com) company.
# These devices have 5 channels: Red, Green, Blue, ColdWhite and WarmWhite. So, 5 monochrome LED strips can be controlled or 1 RGB
# LED strip, plus 2 monochrome LED strips.

# Smart WiFi LED Controller 5 Channels Control 4A5CH CW/WW RGB RGBW RGBWW LED light,
# The physical actuator is managed using a string that represents a set of 6 pairs:
#     power = on | off
#     red   = 0 .. 100    --> percent of red (or white for monochrome)
#     green = 0 .. 100    --> percent of green (or white for monochrome)
#     blue  = 0 .. 100    --> percent of blue (or white for monochrome)
#     cold  = 0 .. 100    --> ColdWhite: percent of monochrome
#     warm  = 0 .. 100    --> WarmWhite: percent of monochrome
# So:
#     "power=on, red=255, green=0, blue=0"
# will switch the LED strip on and se the color to pure red. You can send all values or just those you want to change:
#     "green=255, blue=255"
# as second command, will turn the LED strip into white color.
#
# Take a look to the example to uderstand how to these drivers work.

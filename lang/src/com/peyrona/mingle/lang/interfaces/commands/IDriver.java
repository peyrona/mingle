/**
 * A driver is the link that connects Mingle with the physical world.
 * <p>
 * A driver talks with an IController, which is the one that really knows how to interact with
 * the physical world.
 * <p>
 * A driver changes messages sent by ExEn into messages that can be understood by the controller
 * and send these messages to the controller using the channel that the controller handles
 * (RS-232, USB, Sockets, WebSockets, etc).<br>
 * It also listen to messages sent by the controller and changes them into the kind of messages
 * that ExEn handles.<br>
 * In this way, ExEn is agnostic of the type of messages used by different controllers and all
 * pieces inside ExEn need to know only one set of messages: those used by ExEn.
 * <p>
 * When a script using a low level language (e.g.: Java or Python) adds dynamically a new Driver
 * to the ExEn, it is its responsibility to add also all the devices that driver will manage.

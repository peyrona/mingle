# Questions and Answers

 **Do I need to know about computer programming?**

> No, you do not: as far as you are familiar with spreadsheets (e.g.: MS Excel) you can successfully use _Une_.
> It is also true that the more you know about programming computers and about electronics, the more you will be able to do.

 **What computer do I need?**

> A PC with Windows, macOS, Linux... In fact **Mingle** runs in any machine where Java 11 can run.
> Raspberry Pi is a 50 US$ computer very appropriate to experiment with _Une_.

 **How to install Mingle?**

> 1. Download lastest release (at the right side of this web page: only the "mingle-*.zip" file is needed).
> 2. Create a folder in you PC named "Mingle" (or whatever you like).
> 3. Unzip the downloaded file inside your local "Mingle" folder.
> 4. Either:<br>
>    a) Install Java 11 or above in your local machine.<br>
>    b) Make a folder inside your 'Mingle' folder and make sure the name contains the word "jdk" (e.g. "jdk.11.linux") and place inside this folder all JDK files. You can download JDK from here: [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net)


 **What is the easiest way to start?**

> The "Mingle Standard Platform" is a set of tools created to make easy the daily tasks about _Une_ applications: create, compile, deploy and monitorize. All these tools are integrated in the IDE. So, beginners only need to know the IDE.
>
>
> "Glue" is the name for the IDE (Integrated Development Environment), it has all you need: an editor, a compiler and an Execution Environment (to execute the compiled code).
>
> So, our recommendation is:
> 1.  Start Glue: for Linux, use "menu.sh"; for other OOSS use "run-win.ps1" or "run-mac.sh" file.
> 2.  Open the editor (click the pencil icon at toolbar).
> 3.  Open an example (under 'examples' folder): they are numbered from easiest to smartest.
> 4.  Take "The Une language.pdf" handbook (under "docs" folder).
> 5.  Read, understand and test.
> 6.  Modify the _Une_ source code and re-test.
> 7.  Go to #3


 **What licence has Mingle?**

> Everything is Open Source (under the Apache License 2.0): the language itself, the MSP specifications, all the source code and even the documentation. So everyone can use and distribute everything for free (no charges, never, for nothing).
>
> The books (licensed as Creative Commons) are under "todeploy/docs" folder:
> * Une_language.pdf
> * Mingle_Standard__Platform.pdf
> * Une_reference__sheet.pdf

 **What about the logo?**

> Following the tradition, the mascot for the _Une_ language is an animal, in this case, an electric anguilla named **Tune**. You can use it anywhere, as long as it's related to **Mingle** or _Une_.

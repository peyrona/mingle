# Questions and Answers

 **Do I need to know about computer programming?**

> No, you do not: as far as you are familiar with spreadsheets (e.g.: MS Excel) you can successfully use _Une_.
> It is also true that the more you know about programming computers and about electronics, the more you will be able to do.

 **What computer do I need?**

> A PC with Windows, macOS, Linux... In fact **Mingle** runs in any machine where Java 11 can run.
> Raspberry Pi is a 50 US$ computer very appropriate to experiment with _Une_.

 **How to install Mingle?**

> 1. Download lastest release and unzip it inside a folder (e.g. create a folder named 'Mingle').
>
> 2. If you have Java 11 or above installed in your PC, you are done.<br>
>    Otherwise, execute the appropriate 'get-java-*' script.<br>
>    Note: if need, change the script permissions to make it executable (chmod +x get_java* or similar).

 **What is the easiest way to start?**

> All needed tools are integrated in the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). So, beginners only need to know about the IDE.
> "Glue" is the IDE's name, it has all you need: an editor, a compiler and an Execution Environment (to execute the compiled code).
>
> So, our recommendation is:
> 1.  Start **Glue**: for Linux, use "menu.sh"; for Windows "run-win.ps1", for MacOS "run-mac.sh" file.
> 2.  Open the editor (click the pencil icon at toolbar).
> 3.  Open an example (under 'examples' folder): they are numbered from easiest to smartest.
> 4.  Read, understand and test (play with it).
> 5.  Modify the _Une_ source code and re-test.
> 6.  Go to #3

 **I am an experienced Linux user or a developer**
> Have a look at the script 'run.sh' for lots of information about how to use all the tools that form MSP.

 **What license has Mingle?**

> Everything is Open Source under the Apache License 2.0, including the language itself, the MSP specifications, all the source code and even the documentation.

> The books (licensed as Creative Commons) are under "todeploy/docs" folder:

 **What about the logo?**

> Following the Open Source tradition, the mascot for the _Une_ language is an animal, in this case, an electric anguilla named **Tune**. You can use it anywhere, as long as it's related to **Mingle** or _Une_.
